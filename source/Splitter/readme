MakSplitterView - A class to give you a flexible splitter bar between two BViews

Suppose you have two Lists, but don't know how much space to allow for each. Well, why not let the user of the app decide?
Leave a little gap (recommended 5 pizels) between the two BScrollViews that hold the BListView, stick a MakSplitterView in that gap, give it a colour (grey is a good colour, thats the default) and you're done.
You can even place a horizontal and vertical MakSplitterView together, just ensure you send them the corrent resizing mode flag when you constuct them.


You can use this class as in whatever way you like, but I'd like at least a little credit please.
