<H2><A NAME="Overview"></A><FONT SIZE=6>O</FONT>verview</H2>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>A ColumnListView displays a list of items that can be structured
either in a linear list or an outline form with items grouped under
other items. The levels of the outline are indicated by successive
levels of indentation.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="pics/Linear.jpg" WIDTH=217 HEIGHT=240
X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom><IMG
SRC="pics/Hierarchical.jpg" WIDTH=368 HEIGHT=245 X-SAS-UseImageWidth
X-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom></P>

<P>The items in the list are themselves composed of entries arranged
in columns. The ColumnListView displays a bar containing the column
headings. The user may drag the columns to reorder or resize them,
and those user actions affect all item entries in the column. The
user can click on a column heading to select that column to be used
as the key for sorting, for example by name,by size, by date.
Furthermore, if the user holds shift and clicks another column, the
column can be made a "secondary sorting key." Thus, items could be
sorted by type, with name set as the secondary sorting key so that
the items will be grouped by type, then within each type group, the
items will be alphabetized. Any number of secondary sorting columns
can be selected, with each column being added at a lower priority
than the preceding column.</P>

class that you should use because it will save a lot of work.</P>

<P><HR></P>

<H2><A NAME="Usage"></A>Usage</H2>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The main class is
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B>.
This class contains the content area (i.e. the list itself, not
including scroll bars or the column headers). It is derived from
BListView and behaves much like a BListView or BOutlineListView.
Constructing a
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B> also
constructs a container BScrollView and returns it indirectly via the
<I>containerView</I> argument. The BScrollView contains the
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B>,
scrollbars and border if requested, and the column header view. It is
this container view that should be added to your view hierarchy.
Automatic deletion of the container view and
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B>
automatically through destruction of a parent BView or BWindow works
fine, but if you remove the ColumnListView from a view hierarchy, you
should delete the
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B>, not
the container BView. Technically, you could delete the container view
and that would delete the
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B>, but
it makes for cleaner code to delete the
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B>,
since that's what new returned.</P>

<P>Columns are added to the
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B> via
the
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html#AddColumn()">AddColumn()</A></TT></B>
function. Columns are represented by the
<B><TT><A HREF="CLVColumn.html">CLVColumn</A></TT></B> class. They
are added once and generally left there, and are thereafter
identified by the ordinal position in which they were added to the
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B>.
Columns can be shown or hidden (without having to remove) them using
the
<B><TT><A HREF="CLVColumn.html#SetShown()">SetShown()</A></TT></B>
function. This is convenient because the columns may still be
identified using the same identification index no matter what columns
are hidden or showing.</P>

<P>Items are added to the
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B> via
the
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html#AddItem()">AddItem()</A></TT></B>
and related functions. Items are represented by the
<B><TT><A HREF="CLVListItem.html">CLVListItem</A></TT></B> class.
<B><TT><A HREF="CLVListItem.html">CLVListItem</A></TT></B> is derived
from BListItem, and is used in a similar manner.</P>

<H2><A NAME="License"></A>License</H2>

<P></TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B>, its
associated classes and source code, and the other components of Santa's
Gift Bag are being made publicly available and free to use in freeware
and shareware products with a price under $25 (I believe that shareware
should be cheap). For overpriced shareware (hehehe) or commercial
products, please contact me to negotiate a fee for use. After all, I
did work hard on this class and invested a lot of time into it. That
being said, DON'T WORRY I don't want much. It totally depends on the
sort of project you're working on and how much you expect to make off
it. If someone makes money off my work, I'd like to get at least a
little something.</P>

<P>If any of the components of Santa's Gift Bag are is used in a
shareware or commercial product, I get a free copy.</P>

<P>The source is made available so that you can improve and extend it as
you need. In general it is best to customize your ColumnListView through
inheritance, so that you can take advantage of enhancements and bug fixes
as they become available.  Feel free to distribute the
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B>
source, including modified versions, but keep this documentation and
license with it.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Revision history"></A>Revision history</H2>

<P>2.82: Fixed a bug that prevented CLVEasyItem from working in a non-hierarchical mode.  Made CLVEasyItem properly
truncate strings with a font other than be_plain_font.  Fixed numerous documentation errors.  Made CLVColumn::SetShown()
and CLVColumn::SetSortMode() virtual.  Fixed a bug in CLVEasyItem's dealing with columns that haven't been drawn before.
Fixed problem which caused container view and ColumnListView to have B_NAVIGABLE flag when only ColumnListView should.</P>

<P>2.81: Fixed some internal implementation so that with a CLVEasyItem, you can intercept DrawItemColumn in a subclass and not call the
CLVEasyItem method without causing a crash when you try to resize the column.</P>

<P>2.8: Made sorting more efficient with CLVEasyItem.  Made
BetterScrollView set the scroll steps and page steps to
something that actually makes sense.</P>

<P>2.7: Changed and made public the <B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html#CreateContainer()">CreateContainer()</A></TT></B> function
so that derived classes can also specialize the behavior of the container.
Fixed bug in BetterScrollView that made the ScrollViewCorner appear in the
wrong place with B_FANCY_BORDER (affected ColumnListView, which uses
BetterScrollView).  Numerous other bug fixes which I forgot to document.  :-P
</P>

<P>2.6: Made all classes and sample code build without warnings under
gcc and mwcc with all warnings turned on, and updated the libraries
for R4.</P>

<P>2.5: Enhanced CLVColumn to allow drawing of the column header to
be overridden.  Added optional automated string truncation of the
column header label.  Modified ColumnListView to make string
truncation even easier.  Created CLVEasyItem.</P>

<P>2.3: Bug fixes</P>

<P>2.2: Enhanced CLVListItem to facilitate string truncation</P>

<P>2.1: Bug fixes</P>

<P>2.0: Cleaned up the type casting to make the code more safe and
efficient.</P>

<P>1.8: A few minor, but nonetheless important, improvements.</P>

<P>1.7: Changed how Sorting() function works, added SetSorting()
function.</P>

<P>1.6: Reworked the way sorting works, allowing shift-selection of
multiple columns for sorting, no more semaphore-protected globals, no
more distintion between sorting and boolean grouping.</P>

<P>1.5: Fixed even MORE really embarrassing bugs!!!</P>

<P>1.4: Fixed some embarrassing bugs (crashing bugs that must've been
hidden by my sample and real project somehow...) Can someone throw me
a rope to climb out of this hole?</P>

<P>1.3: Made drawing of list items more efficient (made it check the
clipping region and only call DrawItemColumn if a given column
intersects the clipping region), fixed a few documentation errors.
</P>

<P>1.1: Fixed embarassing bugs, and misfeatures which snuck by.</P>

<P>1.0: Initial fully functional release</P>

<P>0.8: Linear ColumnListView working with items, but no hierarchical
ColumnListView</P>

<P>0.5: Very rough public demo: no items, etc.</P>
