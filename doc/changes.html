    performance information.
<LI>Some small bugfixes.

<LI>Language file for spanish (thanks to Double S).

    are supported.
<LI>X Kill: Simply kill teams by dropping a crosshair on one
    of their windows.
<LI>New command line option: <CODE>--install</CODE>. Shows the installation
    dialog. This way you can change the languge after installation.
</UL>

<H3>Version 0.1.1</H3>

<UL CLASS="doc">
<LI>Removed some run-time warnings (like "Call of IsHidden() 
    without window lock").
<LI>Support for the new R5 deskbar addon API. This means it 
    is no longer necessary to modify the UserBootscript.
<LI>Displays a Net+ like cursor when the mouse hovers over a link.
<LI>Compiled and tested PPC version.
<LI>Some modifications for one button mice context menu support.

<H3>Version 0.1.0</H3>

<UL CLASS="doc">
<LI>Added performance tab.
<LI>Added plugin API.
<LI>Removed all performance information code (CPU usage of 
  teams/threads, memory usage etc.) from the main application
  and moved it to default plugin (taskmanager_default.so).
<LI>Added LM78 motherboard sensor plugin (lm78.so). The plugin 
depends
  on the lm78 driver which is part of Sensor2.

  dialog pops up asking you if you want to kill the debugger.
</UL>

<H3>Version 0.0.9</H3>

<UL CLASS="doc">
<LI>Faster listview redraw thanx to DrawBitmapAsync().
<LI>Sorting bugs in the listview fixed. In the former version the
  list view could not be sorted by "Memory Usage (absolute)".
<LI>The position of the deskbar replicant's tooltip depends now on
  the corner of the screen the deskbar is attached to.
<LI>The views in the usage tab have a one pixel sunken border.
<LI>In the last versions sometimes a B_MOUSE_UP message was lost.
  This resulted in moving the selection in the team view, even
  if the mouse was not down. This was caused by the 
  B_ASYNCHRONOUS_CONTROLS flag which was set for the window.
<LI>I reached a significant display speedup, if only the "Usage" tab
  is displayed. In the last versions every view requested its own
  system_info structure for each pulse cycle.
  In this version the system_info is cached and only requested once
  per cycle. This results in an overall speedup of 120% on my
  computer.
<LI>Every team has a context menu entry which allows the user to send
  a B_QUIT_REQUESTED message to that team. If the team isn't
  reacting on that request within 10 seconds, a dialog pops up,
  asking if you want to kill that team.
<LI>A double click on the deskbar replicant even works on areas which
  are obscured by the tooltip.
<LI>You can set the priority of a team.
</UL>

<H3>Version 0.0.8</H3>

<UL CLASS="doc">
<LI>Less LED view flickering
<LI>New commandline option:
    <TABLE>
    <TR>
    <TD CLASS="descr" BGCOLOR="#DDDDDD" VALIGN="top">--tweak_deskbar</TD>
    <TD CLASS="descr" BGCOLOR="#DDDDDD" VALIGN="top">
        Make deskbar topmost and then quit.<BR>
        You can use your UserBootscript 
        (/boot/home/config/boot/) to make the
        deskbar topmost, every time the computer
        comes up.
        Simply add the line 
        <CODE>&lt;dir&gt;/TaskManager --tweak_deskbar</CODE>
    </TD>
    </TR>
    </TABLE>
</LI>
<LI>The user can select the columns of the team view in the settings
  dialog.
<LI>CPU usage and memory usage are displayed as bars in the team view.
<LI>Some internal changes (Usage of scripting properties instead of
  custom messages, template singleton class for dialog windows).
</UL>

<H3>Version 0.0.7</H3>

<UL CLASS="doc">
<LI>
    Replicant graph views have context menu to:
    <UL CLASS="doc">
    <LI>Change update speed
    <LI>Select CPU (for CPU Graph Views, if multiple CPUs are
        installed)
    </UL>
</LI>
<LI>Added border and context menu to deskbar replicant. It
    also shows a small tooltip with the current CPU usage.
<LI>
    Added command line options:
    <TABLE>
    <TR>
        <TD CLASS="descr" BGCOLOR="#DDDDDD" VALIGN="top">--help</TD>
        <TD CLASS="descr" BGCOLOR="#DDDDDD" VALIGN="top">Display help text.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>

            Remove replicant from deskbar and quit.
        </TD>
    </TR>
    </TABLE>
</LI>
<LI>GUI is now totally font sensitive. My old code assumed the 
   font size to be &lt;= 12. But with Marco Nelissen's FontSelector
   utility the user can specifiy font sizes up to 99. This is
   handled correctly now.
<LI>Included settings dialog which currently contains two settings:
    <TABLE>
    <TR>
    <TD CLASS="descr" BGCOLOR="#DDDDDD" VALIGN="top">
        "Don't hide deskbar replicant on close."
    </TD>
    <TD CLASS="descr" BGCOLOR="#DDDDDD" VALIGN="top">
        Don't remove the deskbar replicant when the application is
        closed.<BR>
        The replicant remains visible. A double click on
        it fires the taskmanager up again.
    </TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
    <TD CLASS="descr" BGCOLOR="#DDDDDD" VALIGN="top">
        "Hide system teams"
    </TD>
    <TD CLASS="descr" BGCOLOR="#DDDDDD" VALIGN="top">
        Hide the system teams (the blue ones) in the team view.
    </TD>
    </TR>
    </TABLE>

<LI>Entering a character in the team view, scrolls to teams that
  start with that character.
<LI>Added option to display the taskmanager in all workspaces.
<LI>Removed a bug, which crashed the taskmanager after closing 
  the "About TaskManager" window.
<LI>The taskmanager includes a new improved blur code for the about
  box. It features alpha blending, constant speed independent
  of the size of the blur matrix and real-time hilbert dithering.
  THANKS CHRIS!
